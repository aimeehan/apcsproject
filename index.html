      <h2>Act 9: Custom Scratch Game</h2>
      <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/420244650/">Deep Sea Race</a></p>
      <p>Click the link above or play the game below! This game can be played with two people, so be sure to grab a friend before starting! Choose an orange scuba diver (who will use the arrow keys to control) vs. a purple scuba diver (who will use the 'wasd' keys to control their movements). Coordinate with your partner to press the space bar at the right time, to touch the red finish line and earn a point. Be sure to avoid the pufferfish, who will prick you back to the beginning, but touching the orange will earn you an extra point! Fastest time to make it to 10 points with your partner wins, so make sure to measure the time spent playing.

			<h2> Genius Hour: Typing </h2>
			<p><a href="https://www.typing.com/student/lessons" > Access the site here! </a></p>
			<p> My Genius Hour for the first semester consisted of learning how to type. As trivial as this sounds, it was enlightening experience as I found typing a good way to destress. Along the way, it improved my technique when it came to typing, such as using different fingers to reach the top and bottom rows. It took over three hours of total typing, but I completed this project within three weeks of Genius Hour, from Beginner to Advanced. Click the link to check out the site for yourself.<p></p>
